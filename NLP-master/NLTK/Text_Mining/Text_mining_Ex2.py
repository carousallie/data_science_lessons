# Question 1:
# What is we want to turn 'goose' into a plural? Add another parameter
# to the plural function with the 'elif...return' syntax to turn
# 'goose' into 'geese' and then test it out. You can copy and paste
# the function above to adjust it
# ===========================================================================================================




# ===========================================================================================================
# Question 2:

# Rerun the two functions we created above with the Reuters corpus:
# nltk.corpus.reuters.words()
# What did you notice about the stopwords from this corpus? Why would
# this number occur?
#
# BONUS: Create a function that only pulls out the stopwords from the
# Reuters text - name this function 'identify_stopwords'.
# Hint: you may want to think about the syntax
# list(set(text1) & set(text2)) to find overlap. Use the remove_stopwords function
# as a reference.
#
# Test out your function on nltk.corpus.reuters.words('test/14829')
# to see what stopwords are in the article

# ===========================================================================================================
# Question 3:
# First find the pronunciation for "green" in the entries list
# Now find all words that rhyme with "green"
# ===========================================================================================================


# ===========================================================================================================
# Question 4:
# Find all the synsets that contain 'book', how many are there?
# What are the difference synsets for subset 01, 07, 05?
# What are the synonyms for each synset?
# What are some examples from synset 09?
# ===========================================================================================================#





# ===========================================================================================================
# Question 5:
# Find all words that end in ','
# Find all two letter words that contain either "n" or "o"
# ===========================================================================================================#
